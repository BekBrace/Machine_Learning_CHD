# Machine_Learning_CHD
This is a tutorial to predict the possibility for males to get hit by coronary heart disease in the next 10 years 
We will checkout the ratio of patients that stand a good chance of being attacked by CVD and also to predict the overall risk; and for that we'll use Logistic Regression.
Logistic Regression is a statistical and machine-learning techniques classifying records of a dataset based on the values of the input fields . 
It predicts a dependent variable based on one or more set of independent variables to predict outcomes .
We have a dataset which is available on Kaggle website [included in the repo], and it is from a cardiovascular study of the residents of Massachusetts , 
and the classification goal is to predict whether the patien has 10 years risk of future coronary heart disease.
This dataset provides info about patiens including over 4K records and 15 attributes.
